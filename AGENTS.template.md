## Context for Agents

### What You Must Know Before Changing Code

1. **Data flows through multiple layers.** A change to the database schema affects Supabase, the web API, and the mobile client. Always check all three.
2. **RLS is the primary security boundary.** Application code can have bugs. RLS policies cannot be bypassed by application bugs. Always verify RLS when touching data access.
3. **Realtime is event-driven.** Many features depend on Supabase Realtime subscriptions. Adding a new table or column for real-time sync requires adding it to the Realtime publication and setting `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`.
4. **Secrets have strict boundaries.** Server-side keys (Firebase Admin SDK, payment gateway keys, service role keys) MUST NEVER exist in client-side code. Mobile never holds server credentials.
5. **Admin is isolated.** Admin users are blocked from patient/doctor interfaces at multiple layers. Never route admin users through patient/doctor flows.

### API Security Pattern
Every API route MUST use the security wrapper:
```
// ALWAYS
withSecurity(handler) → extracts sessionUser from JWT → enforces role check

// NEVER
raw handler → reads userId from request body → trusts client-supplied data
```

### Session Handling
- Web: Use the proxy/middleware to validate sessions on every request. **Performance Rule**: Exclude API routes from middleware matcher and cache user roles in cookies to prevent redundant DB queries.
- Mobile: Use Supabase client with anon key + RLS only
- Never store session tokens in localStorage on web (use httpOnly cookies)
- **Inactivity Timeout**: Implement an auto-logout mechanism (e.g., 15 minutes) based on user interaction (pointer/keyboard events) to comply with healthcare and security standards.

## Compliance & Regulatory

### [HIPAA / GDPR / SOC 2 / PCI-DSS / CCPA — Pick what applies]

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Access Controls | [Implemented/Partial/Needed] | [How] |
| Inactivity Timeout | [Implemented/Needed] | [Auto-logout duration, e.g., 15 mins] |
| Encryption in Transit | [Implemented] | [TLS] |
| Encryption at Rest | [Inherited/Implemented] | [Provider] |
| Audit Logging | [Implemented/Partial/Needed] | [What's logged] |
| Right to Erasure | [Implemented/Needed] | [Deletion flow] |
| Data Export | [Implemented/Needed] | [Format] |
| Consent Collection | [Implemented/Needed] | [At signup] |
| BAA | [Executed/Needed] | [Provider] |
| Breach Notification | [Documented/Needed] | [Timeframe] |

**Agent rules for compliance:**
- Never log PHI/PII to console or log files
- Never store sensitive data in localStorage/SharedPreferences/cookies
- Never share user data with third parties without explicit opt-in
- Never add tracking without consent
- Always provide users a way to view and export their data
- Never hardcode patient/user IDs in client-visible URLs

---

## Security Posture

### Threat Model
| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| SQL Injection | Use parameterized queries (Supabase does this) |
| XSS | Sanitize all API inputs (e.g., DOMPurify) |
| CSRF | JWT in headers, SameSite cookies |
| IDOR | RLS ensures users access only their own rows |
| Privilege Escalation | Role checks at DB + API + UI layers |
| Session Hijacking | Refresh token rotation, session validation |
| Data Leakage | Private storage buckets, role-gated access |

### Secrets Management
| Secret | Location | NEVER |
|---|---|---|
| [Service Role Key] | [Server .env ONLY] | Never in client/mobile code |
| [Admin SDK Key] | [Server .env ONLY] | Never in mobile workspace |
| [Payment Keys] | [Server .env ONLY] | Never in client bundles |
| [Anon Key] | [Client bundles OK] | Never expose to server admin ops |

**Agent rule:** Before adding any credential: "Is this public or secret?" Public keys go in client bundles. Secret keys stay in server-only `.env` files and are never imported in client components.

### Mobile Security Boundary
- Mobile NEVER holds server-side credentials
- Mobile dispatches sensitive operations via web API
- Mobile uses anon key + RLS only

---

## Engineering Discipline

### Code Review Policy
- All changes require review before merge
- Security-sensitive changes require [1/2] reviewer(s)
- Agent-generated code follows the same review process

### Testing Strategy
| Layer | Tool | What to Test |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | [Jest/Vitest/Dart test] | Business logic, data transforms |
| Component | [React Testing Library/Flutter widget tests] | UI rendering, interactions |
| Integration | [Playwright/Cypress/Flutter integration] | End-to-end flows |
| API | [curl/Postman/Supabase SQL Editor] | RLS policies, RPCs |
| Security | Manual review | RLS bypass, role escalation |

**Agent rule:** Check for existing test patterns before adding tests. Match the existing framework. Never remove existing tests.

### CI/CD Gates
- All linters must pass (`npm run lint`, `flutter analyze`)
- All type checks must pass (`tsc --noEmit`, `dart analyze`)
- Build must succeed
- No secrets in committed files
- No hardcoded URLs — use environment variables
- No `console.log`/`print()` with sensitive data in production

### Mandatory Audit Phase (Every Task)
Before marking ANY task as complete, agents MUST complete this verification sequence:

**Web (Next.js):**
1. Run `npm run typecheck` (or `npx tsc --noEmit`) — zero errors required
2. Run `npm run lint` (or `npx eslint src/`) — zero warnings required
3. Run `npm run build` — clean build required
4. Verify no regressions in related components (check imports, shared types)

**Mobile (Flutter):**
1. Run `flutter analyze` — zero errors required
2. Run `flutter test` — all tests pass
3. Run `flutter build apk --flavor user --debug` (or `flutter build ios`) — clean build
4. Verify no regressions in related widgets/screens

**Database (Supabase):**
1. If schema changed: verify `GRANT` statements exist for new tables
2. If new table: verify RLS policies cover all CRUD operations
3. If Realtime needed: verify `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and publication membership
4. Run affected queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify RLS enforcement

**Cross-cutting checks:**
- [ ] No hardcoded URLs — use environment variables
- [ ] No secrets in client-side code
- [ ] No PHI/PII in console/logs
- [ ] All new API routes wrapped in `withSecurity`
- [ ] All new database tables have RLS + GRANTs
- [ ] CSS uses CSS variables (not hardcoded colors) for dark mode support
- [ ] Stream subscriptions stored and cancelled in `dispose()`/cleanup
- [ ] Error handling: no empty catch blocks — log or surface errors

**Agent rule:** Never claim a task is "done" without running the audit phase. If the analyzer/linter/build tool hangs, flag the issue to the user rather than skipping verification.

### Error Handling Convention
```
User-facing errors: Friendly message via toast/snackbar
Internal errors: Log with context (never expose stack traces)
Security errors: Return generic "Unauthorized" (never reveal why)
Database errors: Never expose raw error messages to client
```

**Agent rule:** Every `catch` block must handle the error. Never swallow silently. Never expose internals to users.

### Dependency Management
- Pin major versions
- Audit dependencies monthly (`npm audit`, `dart pub outdated`)
- Never add a dependency without checking if functionality already exists
- Prefer built-in SDK methods over third-party packages
- Document major dependencies in this file

### Naming Conventions
| Element | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Files (JS/TS) | `camelCase` / `kebab-case` | `userService.ts`, `user-profile.tsx` |
| Files (Dart) | `snake_case` | `user_service.dart` |
| Database tables | `snake_case`, plural | `user_profiles`, `forum_posts` |
| Database columns | `snake_case` | `created_at`, `user_id` |
| Enums | `snake_case` values | `emergency_request`, `action_taken` |
| React components | `PascalCase` | `UserProfile`, `BookingCard` |
| Dart widgets | `PascalCase` | `UserProfileScreen` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_RETRY_COUNT` |
| Functions | `camelCase` | `getUserProfile` |

### Git Conventions
- Commit messages: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `perf`
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets
- Branch naming: `feature/description`, `fix/description`
- Always run lint/typecheck before committing

---

## Data Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Single source of truth:** `supabase/schema.sql`
- **Live migrations:** `supabase/update_live.sql`
- **All tables MUST include:** `GRANT` statements, RLS policies, `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` (if using Realtime)

### Data Flow Pattern
```
User Action → Client UI → API/SDK → Database (RLS enforced) → Realtime (if applicable) → Other Clients
```

### Realtime Requirements
For any table that needs real-time sync:
1. Add `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`
2. Add to `supabase_realtime` publication
3. Add RLS policies for `SELECT` (authenticated users)
4. Add client-side subscription filtering by relevant ID

---

## Error & Incident Protocol

### When You Find a Bug
1. **Check if it's a security issue** (auth bypass, data leak, privilege escalation)
2. **Check if it affects data integrity** (wrong writes, missing validation)
3. **Check if it affects real-time sync** (stale data, missing events)
4. **Fix the root cause**, not the symptom
5. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the fix
6. **Verify the fix** with tests or manual verification

### When You're Unsure
1. Read the existing code patterns in similar files
2. Check `CHANGELOG.md` for context on past decisions
3. Search for related issues in git history
4. Ask the user for clarification — don't guess on security-critical decisions

## Monitoring & Alerting
| System | Where to Check |
|---|---|
| Web build errors | [e.g., Vercel/Netlify dashboard] |
| Database errors | [e.g., Supabase Dashboard → Logs] |
| Push notification delivery | [e.g., Firebase Console → Cloud Messaging] |
| Mobile crashes | [e.g., Firebase Crashlytics] |
| API errors | [e.g., Server logs, Sentry] |

---

## Data Retention & Deletion
| Data Type | Retention | Deletion |
|---|---|---|
| User profiles | Until account deletion | Cascade delete |
| [Domain-specific data] | [Duration] | [Method] |
| Audit logs | [7 years recommended] | Never delete |
| Session data | [90 days] | Auto-cleanup |

---

## Compliance Certification Path
1. **Document** — This file IS your documentation baseline
2. **Implement** — Technical controls (RLS, encryption, audit logs)
3. **Verify** — Test controls, run security reviews
4. **Certify** — Engage auditor for SOC 2 / HIPAA / ISO 27001
5. **Maintain** — Update this file when controls change
